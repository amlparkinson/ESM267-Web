# Feasability Map of Zaca Fire Big Cone Stands 

Big cone (Pseudotsuga macrocarpa) is an endemic conifer to southern California. Many stands were devistaed by the 2007 Zaca Fire, which was the second largest fire in state history at the time. The Big Cone project, funded by USFS, is tasked with creating a restoration experiment to try and improve outplanting success, which is currently at 5% suvivorship. Part of this is finding stands within the Zaca scar that are 1. feasible for the field crew to safely and easily access adn 2. suitable for outplanting. 

This map meets the first objective of finding feasible sites. I uploaded the roads and trails within the Zaca scar and created a buffer to find the stands within 1000m and 500m of a road or trail. The map also only includes stands that had less than 50% mortality.
